One day you start off with a brand new system. Ah, the amazing feeling of something new! With time, however, the rush fades and after a bumpy and exciting ride, you arrive at your final destination : comfort, familiarity and productivity. I went through a similar journey with my laptop and now that I find myself in the comfort zone, I felt it appropriate to document my setup lest it ever get lost or for other curious bees to replicate. 

The start of a glorious journey was rather unspectacular : A modest weight, decently built, midrange Windows laptop. I set it up like my colleagues, with Chrome and Office and what not. Oh, these were the dark days. This is when Ubuntu came to the rescue in the form of a dual-boot setup. It's speed, reliability and security blew me away, making me switch away to it full-time. In addition, it ships with Firefox which took me away from Chrome. Not that Windows is bad, it's just that Ubuntu is better. Also not that Chrome is bad, it's just Firefox is better. 

This was the start I needed for the long journey that would span years. My dual-boot setup morphed into a triple-boot, then a quattro-boot and then a penta-boot. I tried all types of OS and finally settled on a Fedora/Windows dual boot with a third OS that keeps changing with time : sometimes Ubuntu, sometimes Manjaro, sometimes elementaryOS, and so on. However, Fedora is the one I finally landed upon due to its leading edge features and stability. This is the setup I use and here is it in detail. As a basis, I use GNOME Shell 40 on Wayland on Fedora 34.
