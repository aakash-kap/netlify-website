title: Hey There, Welcome To My Homepage
---

I am Aakash Kapoor, an incoming PhD Student at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Cornell Univerity. I completed my Bachelors in Technology in Electrical Engineering from Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, along with a minor in Computer Science and Engineering. For an updated version of my resume, you should visit my [curriculum vitae](/cv) page. I have worked for a year and a half at Samsung R&D Institute Bangalore as part of the On-Device team wherein I worked upon AutoML and Neural Architecture Search (NAS). I am currently interested in researching Human-Computer Interfaces for better neural prosthetic devices. 

Personally, I try to keep actively learning new things as they come along. Some of my quirky ways of procrastination include writing with my left hand (yes, I am ambidextrous), doodling, and creating arbitrary rhymes (that may or may not be humorous depeding on your taste). I love playing badminton, table tennis, carrom, and a wide variety of indoor games. I have dabbed around in Web/App development back in my undergraduate days, and I made use of the pandemic years in teaching myself French and cooking. 

I am an avid blogger and you can find my blogs at the following places (in addition to the blog [here](/blog)) -
* [Prepsera](https://prepsera.wordpress.com) : A blog for guiding students to help them score better in multiple competetive examinations
* [Think](https://dualbootlife.wordpress.com) : This is a slightly different blog wherein me and two of my friends post poetry, prose and our thoughts and opinions on things that make you reflect about life
* [ThePrisol](https://theprisol.wordpress.com) : A more self-reflective blog wherein I compose longer articles, poems and book reviews (yes, I am an avid reader and I review books from time to time). 

If you would like to collaborate with me on any interesting projects, or if you wish to reach out to me regarding research interests, or if you just want to pop in and say hi, do feel free to contact me at the e-mail address mentioned in my [curriculum vitae](/cv)
